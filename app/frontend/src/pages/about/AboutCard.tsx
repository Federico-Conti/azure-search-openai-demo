                            Applying our expertise around Large Language Models and leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation approach (RAG), we have realized a
                            first pilot of a chatbot (ChatICT) that we are glad to offer as a frontline point of contact for our ICT Service Desk.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our ChatICT POC complements a traditional virtual assistant with Generative AI technology (gpt3.5 model with Hybrid search). This
                            way, it combines ICT service knowledge stored in our policies, procedures, and user guides with our experience on user interaction.
                        </p>
                        ChatICT is also accessible through the IIT MS-Teams platform and is able to do the following:
